‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions

Q: Does GoH2o collect or share my personal data?

A: No. GoH2o runs 100% offline and never collects or stores your data outside your device.

Q: I changed phones. Can I restore my hydration history?

A: Hydration data is saved locally, so be sure to export your data before switching devices.

Q: How do I stop reminders?

A: You can disable reminders directly within the app or in your phone‚Äôs notification settings.

Q: Why does the app ask for location access?

A: If granted, GoH2o uses your location only while the app is open to simulate climate conditions and suggest hydration goals based on your local region. This is optional and does not track or store your location.

Q: Does GoH2o need access to my health data, photos, or files?

A: No. GoH2o does not access your health records, contacts, photos, or files. Any chart export or image sharing is entirely optional and user-initiated.

Q: Can I use the app in liters instead of ounces?

A: Yes! GoH2o supports liters (L) for global users. You can toggle between ounces (oz) and liters (L) at any time. Your preference is applied instantly across charts, stats, and tracking.

Q: Does the app support kilograms (kg) and centimeters (cm)?

A: Yes. GoH2o now supports kg and cm for weight and height input. You can easily switch between imperial (lbs, ft/in) and metric (kg, cm) systems, and your values will be synced automatically.

Q: Will switching units erase my previous data?

A: No. Switching between imperial and metric updates the display and input options, but your hydration history and personal data remain intact.
