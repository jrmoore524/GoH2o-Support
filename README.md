‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions

Q: Does GoH2o require an account?
A: No. GoH2o works 100% offline and does not require you to create an account to track your hydration.

Q: I changed phones. Can I restore my hydration history?
A: Hydration data is saved locally on your device. Be sure to export your data before switching devices to keep a copy.

Q: How do I stop reminders?
A: You can disable reminders directly within the app or through your phone‚Äôs notification settings.

Q: Why does the app ask for location access?
A: If granted, GoH2o uses your location while the app is open to simulate climate conditions and suggest hydration goals based on your region. Location access is optional and only used during active app sessions.

Q: Does GoH2o need access to my health data, photos, or files?
A: No. GoH2o does not access your health records, contacts, photos, or files. Any chart export or image sharing is entirely optional and user-initiated.

Q: Can I use the app in liters instead of ounces?
A: Yes! GoH2o supports liters (L) for global users. You can toggle between ounces (oz) and liters (L) at any time. Your preference is applied instantly across charts, stats, and tracking.

Q: Does the app support kilograms (kg) and centimeters (cm)?
A: Yes. GoH2o supports kg and cm for weight and height input. You can easily switch between imperial (lbs, ft/in) and metric (kg, cm) systems, and your values will be synced automatically.

Q: Will switching units erase my previous data?
A: No. Switching between imperial and metric updates the display and input options, but your hydration history and personal data remain intact.
